projects:
  - name: "Process Management and Deployment (PoC)"
    occupation: "CERN, Beam Department, Control Group, Infrastructure Section"
    dates: "08/2015--Present"
    description:
      "One of our most challenging projects at CERN BE-CO-IN section was to design and implement
      the Proof of Concept platform that could replace the former legacy service management solution,
      while keeping the interface and release-deploy-configure workflow for users backward compatible.
      The platform consisted of Python and Ansible-based tool for deployment of the accelerators controls applications,
      adding/removing the services to/from an applications database (to make them persistent across installations),
      and generating configuration for service monitoring and management (based on monit).
      Additionally, we provided a consistent solution for supplying the user specific checks for a service or group of services."

  - name: "System Administration Modernisation Project"
    occupation: "CERN, Beam Department, Control Group, Infrastructure Section"
    dates: "04/2015--Present"
    description:
      "The goal of System Administration Modernisation Project was to review current system administration practices and proposes
      and implement an integrated set of tools, procedures and workflows in order to bring the benefits of modern software development
      techniques to the maintenance of the control system computing environment.  Particular emphasis was placed upon testing,
      staging and reproducibility of configurations.\\\

      \\\

      My responsibilities in the project have been mostly related to the transformation of an old bash/awk/Python script-based
      configuration management to a modern Ansible-based solution. One of the main goals of the project was to replace
      inconsistent (and in some cases non-existing) version controlling systems of various parts of system configuration with a single git tree.\\\

      Some of the most interesting challenges I have faced included developing Ansible playbooks for:\\\

      - converting Python-based variable database into a set of Ansible variables\\\

      - converting specific sudo and SSH configuration for all machines\\\

      - implementing a filesystem monitoring system based on auditd, rsyslog, Elasticsearch, Logalike and Kibana (dashboards)\\\

      - massive analysis, comparison, fixing errors and making more consistent of kickstart files for all 2000+ machines (included also changes in PXE servers and generating kickstart files based on Ansible inventory file and CERN's internal sources of data about hosts)\\\

      - creating monit configuration for process management and monitoring."

  - name: "Accelerator Project Exploitation Tools - Tracing"
    occupation: "CERN, Beam Department, Control Group, DevOps Section"
    dates: "05/2015--Present"
    description:
      "Accelerator Project Exploitation Tools (ACET) provided the accelerator operations crew and operations experts with
      diagnostic and troubleshooting tools. ACET Tracing was a logging service based on Elasticsearch, Kibana and Logalike stack.
      Tracing served graphical views of logging data over time and was useful to visually diagnose problems, either by exploratory
      searches or pre-defined views of the data. Tracing used Elasticsearch for storage and indexing, and Kibana for data representation.
      Logalike served as an integration tool collecting the data from various sources; it processed, cached and finally sent the data
      as an input to Elasticsearch datastore.\\\

      \\\

      My main responsibility in DO has been system administration activities regarding the Elasticsearch/Logalike/Kibana clusters,
      that served as a database, search and dashboarding system for the accelerator controls applications and Linux servers' logging.\\\

      Among numerous tasks in this area, I have been working on:\\\

      - preparation of the operation systems for the smooth clusters operation\\\

      - upgrade to ES 2.0 and Kibana 4\\\

      - creation of nginx reverse proxy configuration\\\

      - creation of monit configuration and checks for all ELK services\\\

      - a little bit of Java 8 programming (Logalike extension)."

  - name: "Automated Delivery Pipeline for building RPM packages"
    occupation: "Linux Polska"
    dates: "02/2015--03/2016"
    description:
      "At Linux Polska I have had the opportunity to work with two great Linux professionals on an exciting DevOps project.
      The system we have been developing was an Automated Delivery Pipeline for building RPM packages based set of bash scripts
      combined into consistent chain of jobs (and eventual rollbacks) in Jenkins.\\\

      \\\

      My responsibilities in the project included maintenance of the crucial services: Jenkins, GitLab.
      I have developed also multitude of mostly bash (and sometimes Python) scripts. I have managed also our git repositories.
      For building RPM packages we have used set of open source tools (mostly from Fedora Project):
      koji, mock, mash/createrepo, revisor/pungi, Sigul.
      Our testing environment was based on Vagrant, Packer, RHEV's virtual machines spawned during
      the testing phase and removed after it success or failure. We have monitored all services using Zabbix."
