projects:
  - name: "Process Management and Deployment (PoC)"
    occupation: "CERN BE-CO-IN"
    dates: "08/2015--Present"
    description:
      "One of our most challenging projects at CERN BE-CO-IN section was to design and implement
      the Proof of Concept platform that could replace the former legacy service management solution,
      while keeping the interface and release-deploy-configure workflow for users backward compatible.
      The platform consisted of Python and Ansible-based tool for deployment of the accelerators controls applications,
      adding/removing the services to/from an applications database (to make them persistent across installations),
      and generating configuration for service monitoring and management (based on monit).
      Additionally, we provided a consistent solution for supplying the user specific checks for a service or group of services."

  - name: "System Administration Modernisation Project"
    occupation: "CERN BE-CO-IN"
    dates: "04/2015--Present"
    description:
      "The goal of System Administration Modernisation Project was to review current system administration practices and proposes and implement an integrated set of tools, procedures and workflows in order to bring the benefits of modern software development techniques to the maintenance of the control system computing environment.  Particular emphasis was placed upon testing, staging and reproducibility of configurations.

The following areas were addressed:
* Configuration Management (Ansible) and Version Control (git)
* Installation and Configuration (PXE, kickstart)
* Process Management and Monitoring (monit, auditd)
* Tracing and Log Analysis (rsyslog, Elasticsearch/Logalike/Kibana)"

  - name: "Accelerator Project Exploitation Tools - Tracing"
    occupation: "CERN BE-CO-IN"
    dates: "05/2015--Present"
    description:
      "Accelerator Project Exploitation Tools (ACET) provide the accelerator operations crew and operations experts with good diagnostic and troubleshooting tools. ACET Tracing is a logging service based on Elasticsearch, Kibana and Logalike stack. Tracing serves graphical views of logging data over time and is useful to visually diagnose problems, either by exploratory searches or pre-defined views of the data. Tracing uses Elasticsearch for storage and indexing and Kibana for data representation. Logalike serves as an integration tool collecting the data from various sources; it process, caches and finally sends the data as an input to Elasticsearch datastore.

CERN's Logalike, lookalike of Logstash written in Java 8, is an open source project available at github: https://github.com/CERN-BE/logalike"

  - name: "Automated Delivery Pipeline for building RPM packages"
    occupation: "Linux Polska"
    dates: "02/2015--03/2016"
    description:
      "At Linux Polska I have had the opportunity to work with two great Linux ninjas on an exciting DevOps project. The system we have been developing was an Automated Delivery Pipeline for building RPM packages based set of bash scripts combined into consistent chain of jobs (and eventual rollbacks) in Jenkins. My responsibilities in the project included maintenance of the services crucial - Jenkins, GitLab. I have developed also multitude of mostly bash (and sometimes Python) scripts versioned in git repositories. For building RPM packages we have used set of open source tools (mostly from Fedora Project) - koji, mock, mash/createrepo, revisor/pungi, Sigul. Our testing environment was based on Vagrant, Packer, RHEV's virtual machines spawned during the testing phase and removed after it success or failure. We have monitored all services using Zabbix."
